# Magic Frequencies

Some people claim that specific frequences have a certain effect on the human mind.
Why not give it a try?
Be warned though: There are rumors that a sinusoid at 666Hz summons the devil.
There is actually a competition (just google around - you will find it!) that awards a prize of 1 million dollars to the person who succeeds in finding the frequency that makes the devil appear.
There is a debate around the questions of scientific value of such competitions - since, as it has been correctly pointed out, there is a hack:

1. First summon the devil by whatever means
2. Sign a contract with him that binds the devil to make you win the aforementioned competition
