# Sinusoids

Linguists claim that the word "Sinus" etymologically is rooted in Latin and is supposed to mean a fold in a garment or figuratively sometimes refers to "bosom" or "gulf" in the sense of "The Bosom of the Sea". In Anatomy, it refers to an arc or cavity of the body, such as in "Sinus Urogenitalis".
We should, of course, distance ourselves from these perverts.
